# Install and Run
I recommend installing it using the `requirements.txt` file, and using the python virtual environment features. 

Firstly, to activate a Python Virtual Environment:
 - In case you don't have venv installed, run `pip install virtualenv`
 - Create a python virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv`
 - Activate the python virtual environment by using `source venv/bin/activate`
 - Install the required dependencies by typing `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - When you want to stop using the virtual environment simply type: `deactivate`
